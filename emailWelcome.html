		Thanks for signing up to be a Food Donor, and welcome to the Medford 
		Food Project! We've been really busy with our most recent food 
		collection, which took place last Saturday. Good news:&nbsp; <font class="yiv869889814Apple-style-span" color="#E50000"><b >On April 14th, </b>	</font>	<font class="yiv869889814Apple-style-span" color="#FF0000"><b>we picked up&nbsp;<font class="yiv869889814Apple-style-span" color="#3634D4">21,000 lbs. of food&nbsp;</font>in the Medford area…and&nbsp;<font class="yiv869889814Apple-style-span" color="#3634D4">23 tons</font>&nbsp;in the whole county</b></font>. Next time, with your help, we hope to collect even more!

				Just to remind you, our program is really simple.&nbsp;Every week when you go to 
				the supermarket (starting this week!), buy an extra item or two. Store 
				the extra food in your green MFP bag…and on a the 2nd Saturday of every 
				even month &nbsp;(Feb, April, June. Aug. Oct, and Dec.), one of your 
				neighbors will come by to&nbsp;pick it up. You don't even have to be there --
				 you can leave it out for them. Don't worry&nbsp;about forgetting the date: 
				we'll send you a reminder e-mail a week before the pickup, then again a 
				day before. All you'll have to do is put the food outside your front 
				door.&nbsp;
				<b>
					<font class="yiv869889814Apple-style-span" color="#E50026">
						Our next pickup is June 9.
					</font>
				</b>

			<div>Your participation really matters.&nbsp;

						T</font><font class="yiv869889814Apple-style-span" color="#3051ED">his year, more than 30,000 Jackson County residents will need emergency supplies of food --&nbsp;<i>a whopping 15% of the population!</i>&nbsp;
					</font>
				</b>
				It's very sad. But that's why your willingness to be part of this great program is so wonderful. Our neighbors need help -- and working together we can do something about it. This is the true meaning of community. When each of us pitches in a little, we can accomplish a lot.

				&nbsp;If you don't already have one of our green Medford Food Project bags to use for food storage, they'll bring you one.&nbsp;
